# Portal Turismo Site

## Project identity
- Project: portal-turismo-site
- Local path: C:\Users\Powerpc\Portal-turismo-site
- Deploy command:
  npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name portal-turismo-portugal-site --commit-dirty=true

## Product priorities
Prioritize in this order unless the user says otherwise:
1. Fix real bugs with commercial impact
2. Mobile-first UX
3. Perceived performance
4. Stable funnels
5. Real CRM/commercial operations
6. Monetization clarity
7. SEO/content expansion
8. Premium polish after core flows are stable

## Current strategic priorities
- English translation across the main commercial pages
- Correct B2B pricing and commercial clarity
- Automatic planning instead of any delayed-manual planning promise
- SEO content pages with real keyword intent
- PWA and push notifications later, not before core funnel/content work
- Fix critical bugs from prior audits
- Improve performance/loading
- Strengthen sales copy page by page
- Improve Media Kit and future partner/investor deck

## Token-efficiency rules
- Do not do repo-wide discovery unless file location is truly unknown
- If the target file is already known, go straight to implementation
- Read only the minimum blocks needed
- Avoid re-auditing already validated areas
- Prefer small, high-impact batches
- Avoid global refactors unless there is proven need
- Reuse existing patterns instead of inventing architecture
- For larger batches, prefer a fresh Claude Code session

## Model routing
- Haiku: only for cheap discovery when file location is uncertain
- Sonnet: default for implementation and normal debugging
- Opus: only for serious structural ambiguity or hard blockers

## Known high-value files
- index.html
- planear.html
- precos.html
- login.html
- dashboard.html
- parceiros.html
- media-kit.html
- contact.html
- beaches.html
- beach.html
- surf.html
- pesca.html
- webcams.html

## Hard guardrails
- Do not touch auth logic without proven reason
- Do not touch LemonSqueezy flow without proven reason
- Do not touch GA4 tracking without proven reason
- Do not reopen CRM foundations without proven reason
- Do not refactor large stable areas for style only
- Do not change validated commercial flows casually

## Preferred execution style
When implementing:
1. State the exact next batch
2. Target only the needed files
3. Make localized changes
4. Validate the affected flow
5. Deploy at the end
6. Return:
   - files changed
   - what changed
   - regressions avoided
   - deploy URL

## Prompt format preference
Use this structure when preparing execution:
- Objective
- Models to use
- Files
- Change
- Test
- Deploy
- Delivery

## Current rule for tool stack
Use the right tooling in this order:
1. Official LSP for the stack
2. Project-specific skill and hook to reduce rediscovery/log noise
3. Only after that consider design/media MCPs like Stitch, 21st.dev, or Nano Banana 2

## Important note
This repository is optimized by doing the smallest commercially meaningful next step, not by broad exploration.
